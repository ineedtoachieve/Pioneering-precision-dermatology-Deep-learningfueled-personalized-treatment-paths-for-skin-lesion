# Pioneering-precision-dermatology-Deep-learningfueled-personalized-treatment-paths-for-skin-lesion

This repository focuses on **Skin Lesion Classification and Personalized Treatment** using **Deep Learning** techniques. The implementation is inspired by research on precision dermatology, utilizing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning for accurate diagnosis and customized therapy recommendations.

## Overview
This project aims to:
- Accurately classify skin lesions into benign and malignant categories.
- Provide personalized treatment paths by integrating patient-specific data.
- Use advanced deep learning models for robust image analysis and diagnosis.

## Features
- **HAM10000 Dataset**: Used for training and validation, containing over 10,000 dermoscopic images.
- **CNN Architecture**: Includes convolutional and pooling layers for feature extraction.
- **Transfer Learning**: Incorporates pre-trained models like VGG16 or ResNet to enhance performance.
- **Data Balancing**: Handles dataset imbalances for better accuracy.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Incorporates patient data such as skin type and medical history for tailored treatment plans.

## Dataset
The project uses the **HAM10000 Dataset**, which consists of dermoscopic images of skin lesions. The dataset is publicly available via the **ISIC repository**.

### Classes of Skin Lesions
1. Dermatofibroma (df)
2. Vascular lesions (vas)
3. Actinic keratoses (akiec)
4. Basal cell carcinoma (bcc)
5. Benign keratosis-like lesions (bkl)
6. Melanoma (mel)
7. Melanocytic nevi (nv)

## Model Architecture
1. **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**:
   - Multiple convolutional and pooling layers.
   - Dropout layers to prevent overfitting.
2. **Transfer Learning**:
   - Pre-trained models like VGG16/ResNet.
   - Fine-tuned for lesion classification.
3. **Activation and Optimization**:
   - ReLU activation function.
   - Adam optimizer and categorical cross-entropy loss function.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/skin-lesion-classification.git
   ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download the HAM10000 dataset and place it in the `data/` directory.

## Usage
1. Preprocess the dataset:
   ```bash
   python preprocess.py
   ```
2. Train the model:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Evaluate the model:
   ```bash
   python evaluate.py
   ```
4. Generate personalized treatment recommendations:
   ```bash
   python recommend.py
   ```

## Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of **76.68%** in classifying skin lesions.
- Personalized treatment plans were generated using patient-specific data.

## Future Work
- Improve accuracy by fine-tuning the model.
- Validate the model in real-world clinical scenarios.
- Develop an interactive user interface for dermatologists.
