# Pioneering-precision-dermatology-Deep-learningfueled-personalized-treatment-paths-for-skin-lesion
Overview
This repository contains the implementation of a deep learning-based solution for accurate diagnosis and personalized treatment recommendations for skin lesions. The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning to classify skin lesions and generate individualized treatment plans based on patient-specific data.

Features
Accurate Classification: Distinguishes between benign and malignant skin lesions using the HAM10000 dataset.
Personalized Treatment Recommendations: Considers skin type, medical history, and lesion characteristics.
Automated Diagnosis: Reduces dependency on manual visual assessments, saving time and improving accuracy.
Dataset
The HAM10000 dataset is used for training and testing the model. It contains over 10,000 labeled images of skin lesions.
You can access the dataset here.

Architecture
The model is built using:

Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): For feature extraction and classification.
Transfer Learning: Pre-trained models like VGG16 and ResNet are fine-tuned for this specific task.
Prerequisites
Libraries:
Python 3.8+
TensorFlow/Keras
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn
OpenCV
Installation:
Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SkinLesionDetection.git
cd SkinLesionDetection
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Step 1: Data Preprocessing
Prepare the dataset by resizing images, normalizing pixel values, and splitting it into training, validation, and testing sets.

Step 2: Model Training
Run the training script to train the CNN model:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Step 3: Evaluation
Evaluate the model's accuracy, precision, and recall using the test set:

bash
Copy code
python evaluate_model.py
Step 4: Generate Predictions
Classify new skin lesion images and get personalized treatment recommendations:

bash
Copy code
python predict.py --image_path path_to_image
Results
Classification Accuracy: 76.68%
Evaluation Metrics: Detailed performance analysis includes precision, recall, and F1-score.
Future Work
Enhance model accuracy with advanced architectures.
Validate the model in real-world clinical settings.
Develop a user-friendly interface for dermatologists.
